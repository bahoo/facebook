Facebook Timer
==============

Because, if you're like me, it's easy to slip into a social media vortex and blow through a lot of time on FB.

Inspired by Merlin Mann's wonderful [What Are You Doing Right Now?](http://www.merlinmann.com/rightnow/), I've created a basic little reminder that, one day, you too, will die.

Uses @defunkt's [dotjs](https://github.com/defunkt/dotjs), just drop this file into your `~/.js/` folder and you'll be on your way to doing something better in no time.

Happy Social Media-ing!
